Better, in fact.</p>\n<p>If there was even a small chance someone else would use this package, I’d want them to have a pleasant experience, because this package would be tied back to me.</p>\n<p>And then I realized, I should write packages more often. Maybe even whenever possible. </p>\n<p>And maybe you should too, so here’s a short guide on how to start creating your own NPM packages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"./salty_egg.jpg\" alt=\"Chinese Salty Egg\">\n** should be a gif of the feedback widget in action**</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a user, I want to leave feedback for a site that’s almost perfect, minus one feature</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a product owner, I want a direct channel for customers to express their needs or problems</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>For custom components that are commonly used (for example, a feedback box) well that’s a practically infinite space to create shareable modules. </p>\n<p>I’m sure you can think of a few just off the top of your head. </p>\n<p>Writing a component package, with NPM in mind, also forces us to write better code (since we may not be the only one using it).</p>\n<p>So let’s dive in. And here’s a short video if you would prefer (text continues below)</p>\n<p>Let’s make a directory and install the minimal set of dependencies.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">mkdir feedbk-client\ncd feedbk-client\nnpm init -y\nnpm i react react-dom webpack babel</code></pre></div>\n<p>we’ll use a pretty standard webpack config</p>\n<p><div id=\"gist90436059\" class=\"gist\">\n    <div class=\"gist-file\">\n      <div class=\"gist-data\">\n        <div class=\"js-gist-file-update-container js-task-list-container file-box\">\n  <div id=\"file-syntax-text\" class=\"file\">\n    \n\n  <div itemprop=\"text\" class=\"Box-body p-0 blob-wrapper data type-text \">\n      \n<table class=\"highlight tab-size js-file-line-container\" data-tab-size=\"8\">\n      <tr>\n        <td id=\"file-syntax-text-L1\" class=\"blob-num js-line-number\" data-line-number=\"1\"></td>\n        <td id=\"file-syntax-text-LC1\" class=\"blob-code blob-code-inner js-file-line\">&lt;operation&gt; [n]&gt; /dev/null [options]</td>\n      </tr>\n</table>\n\n\n  </div>\n\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"gist-meta\">\n        <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/weirdpattern/ce54fdb1e5621b5966e146026995b974/raw/83e7ad9d06525f3becfafb2f32ffa3122e8e846e/syntax.text\" style=\"float:right\">view raw</a>\n        <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/weirdpattern/ce54fdb1e5621b5966e146026995b974#file-syntax-text\">syntax.text</a>\n        hosted with &#10084; by <a href=\"https://github.com\">GitHub</a>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n</div></p>\n<p>Let’s use <a href=\"http://material-ui.com\">Material UI</a> for atomic components, as building blocks.
